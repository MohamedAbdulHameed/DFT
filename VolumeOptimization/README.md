An automated volume optimization DFT calculation using QE.

A Bash/Python code is written to:
  - Generate input file with different cell volumes,
  - Run them,
  - Extract the total energy from the output files, and
  - Plot total energy as a function of volume to get the optimum lattice parameter.

Just run `loop.sh` to get the whole thing done.
