&SYSTEM
    ibrav = 0               ! Bravais-lattice index. (ibrav = 0) means that the lattice vectors are specified in CELL_PARAMETERS. With (ibrav = 0) lattice vectors must be given with a sufficiently large number of digits and with the correct symmetry. If not, symmetry detection may fail and strange problems may arise in symmetrization.
    A     = 2.70610         ! Lattice parameter. If (ibrav = 0), only A is used and lattice vectors are read from CELL_PARAMETERS.
    nat   = 4               ! Number of atoms in the unit cell.
    ntyp  = 2               ! Number of types of atoms in the unit cell.
    ecutwfc			= 90    ! Kinetic energy cutoff for wavefunctions (Ry).
	ecutrho			= 900   ! Kinetic energy cutoff for charge density and potential (Ry). Default = 4*ecutwfc. For norm-conserving PP, stick to the default. If reduced a little, it will introduce noise especially on forces and stress. For ultrasoft PP, a larger value than the default is often desirable (typically, ecutrho = 8 to 12 times ecutwfc).
	input_dft		= 'pbe'       	! Exchange-correlation functional. Overrides the value read from the pseudopotential files.
	occupations	    = 'smearing'    ! For metals at 0 K, there is a sudden drop in electron occupation at the Fermi energy, which is bad for numerical integration. To resolve this issue, the drop is smoothed. Two general approaches exist for this smoothing: (a) smearing ('smearing'), and (b) Bloechl's tetrahedron method ('tetrahedra').
	smearing		= 'cold'      	! Several schemes exist for smearing: (1) Gaussian smearing ('gaussian' or 'gauss') (Default), (2) Fermi-Dirac smearing ('fermi-dirac', 'f-d' or 'fd'), (3) Methfessel-Paxton first-order smearing ('methfessel-paxton', 'm-p', or 'mp'), and (4) Marzari-Vanderbilt-DeVita-Payne cold smearing ('marzari-vanderbilt', 'm-v', 'mv', or 'cold').
	degauss			= 0.005d0     	! Value of the occupation spreading/smoothing in energy units (Ry). Numbers are expressed in exponential notation.

&ELECTRONS
	conv_thr    	= 1.d-8			! If the difference between an inital and final values <= conv_thr, the calculation has converged to a solution. Default = 1.d-6.
	mixing_beta 	= 0.7d0			! In the case of non-convergence in a self-consistent calculation, "mixing_beta" is how much of the initial value is added to the final value to suppress fluctuations in solutions. That is, the new trial solution is a linear combination of the inital and final values of the self-consistent scheme. Default = 0.7d0.
