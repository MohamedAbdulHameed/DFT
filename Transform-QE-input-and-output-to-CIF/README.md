***This method is partly by [Mohammad Ali Mohebpour](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad-Ali-Mohebpour).***

1. Upload the QE input/output file to XCrySDen: `File` > `Open PWscf...`.
3. Export the file to the XSF format: `File` > `Save XSF Structure`.
4. Upload the XSF file to Vesta.
5. Save the file as a CIF file.
6. The generated CIF files lacks any symmetry information, so use [this tutorial](https://github.com/MohamedAbdulHameed/DFT/tree/main/CIF-Tutorial) to make it contain all the symmetry information of the crystal.
