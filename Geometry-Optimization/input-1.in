&SYSTEM
    ibrav = 0               ! Bravais-lattice index. (ibrav = 0) means that the lattice vectors are specified in CELL_PARAMETERS. With (ibrav = 0) lattice vectors must be given with a sufficiently large number of digits and with the correct symmetry. If not, symmetry detection may fail and strange problems may arise in symmetrization.
    A     = 3.97440         ! Lattice parameter. If (ibrav = 0), only A is used and lattice vectors are read from CELL_PARAMETERS.
    nat   = 4               ! Number of atoms in the unit cell.
    ntyp  = 2               ! Number of types of atoms in the unit cell.
    ecutwfc	= 90    		! Kinetic energy cutoff for wavefunctions (Ry).
    ecutrho	= 900			! Kinetic energy cutoff for charge density and potential (Ry). Default = 4*ecutwfc. For norm-conserving PP, stick to the default. If reduced a little, it will introduce noise especially on forces and stress. For ultrasoft PP, a larger value than the default is often desirable (typically, ecutrho = 8 to 12 times ecutwfc).
	input_dft		= 'pbe'			! Exchange-correlation functional. Overrides the value read from the pseudopotential files.
	occupations	    = 'smearing'    ! For metals at 0 K, there is a sudden drop in electron occupation at the Fermi energy, which is bad for numerical integration. To resolve this issue, the drop is smoothed. Two general approaches exist for this smoothing: (a) smearing ('smearing'), and (b) Bloechl's tetrahedron method ('tetrahedra').
	smearing		= 'cold'      	! Several schemes exist for smearing: (1) Gaussian smearing ('gaussian' or 'gauss') (Default), (2) Fermi-Dirac smearing ('fermi-dirac', 'f-d' or 'fd'), (3) Methfessel-Paxton first-order smearing ('methfessel-paxton', 'm-p', or 'mp'), and (4) Marzari-Vanderbilt-DeVita-Payne cold smearing ('marzari-vanderbilt', 'm-v', 'mv', or 'cold').
	degauss			= 0.005d0     	! Value of the occupation spreading/smoothing in energy units (Ry). Numbers are expressed in exponential notation.

&ELECTRONS
	conv_thr    = 1.d-8			! If the difference between an inital and final values <= conv_thr, the calculation has converged to a solution. Default = 1.d-6.
	mixing_beta = 0.7d0			! In the case of non-convergence in a self-consistent calculation, "mixing_beta" is how much of the initial value is added to the final value to suppress fluctuations in solutions. That is, the new trial solution is a linear combination of the inital and final values of the self-consistent scheme. Default = 0.7d0.

&IONS ! REQUIRED if calculation = 'relax', 'md', 'vc-relax', or 'vc-md'. OPTIONAL for calculation = 'scf' (only ion_positions is used).
        ion_dynamics = "bfgs"
/

! Specify the type of ionic dynamics. For different type of calculation different possibilities are allowed and different default values apply:
! CASE (calculation = 'relax')
! 'bfgs': (default) use BFGS quasi-newton algorithm, based on the trust radius procedure, for structural relaxation. 'damp': use damped (quick-min Verlet) dynamics for structural relaxation.

&CELL                     ! Use only if calculation = 'vc-relax' or 'vc-md'.

  cell_dynamics  = "bfgs" ! Specify the type of dynamics for the cell.
! For different types of calculation different possibilities are allowed and different default values apply.
! CASE (calculation = 'vc-relax')
! 'bfgs': BFGS quasi-newton algorithm (default). ion_dynamics must be 'bfgs' too.
  press          = 0.0d0  ! Target pressure [kbar] in a variable-cell md or relaxation run.
  press_conv_thr = 0.5d0  ! Convergence threshold on the pressure for variable cell relaxation ('vc-relax'). Note that the other convergence thresholds for ionic relaxation apply as well.
